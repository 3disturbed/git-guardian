# git-push-confirmation

### Purpose

This code, when added to a .bashrc file, will jump in when the user attempts to run `git push`, 
and ask them to confirm that they have already pulled any recent changes from the remote repo.

Edit .bashrc with your text editor of choice, add the lines in add_to_bashrc.sh, and run

`source ./.bashrc`

Enjoy!
